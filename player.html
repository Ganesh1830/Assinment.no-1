    <h1>Kabaddi Stars</h1>
    <hr />
    <p style="font-size: large">
      Kabaddi is one of the most popular traditional sports of India, known for
      its strength, speed, and teamwork. The players of Kabaddi play a very
      important role in making the game exciting and competitive. A Kabaddi team
      usually consists of seven players on the court, and each player has a
      specific role such as raider, defender, or all-rounder. Every player must
      be physically fit, mentally strong, and quick in decision-making. Raiders
      are the most active players in Kabaddi. Their main job is to enter the
      opponent’s court, touch as many defenders as possible, and return safely
      to their own half while chanting “kabaddi.” Famous raiders like Pardeep
      Narwal and Pawan Sehrawat are known for their speed, agility, and scoring
      ability. A good raider needs excellent stamina, balance, and presence of
      mind. Defenders are equally important in Kabaddi. Their role is to stop
      the raider from returning to the other side by using techniques like ankle
      holds, thigh holds, and chain tackles. Strong defenders such as Fazel
      Atrachali and Surjeet Singh are admired for their strength and teamwork.
      Defenders must have good coordination and timing to successfully tackle
      the raider. All-rounders are players who can perform well both in raiding
      and defending. They are valuable assets to the team because they can
      change the game at any moment. Players like Maninder Singh and Deepak
      Niwas Hooda are examples of skilled all-rounders who contribute in both
      areas. Kabaddi players follow a strict training routine that includes
      physical exercise, practice matches, and strategy planning. They focus on
      building strength, flexibility, and endurance. Discipline and dedication
      are essential qualities for a Kabaddi player. Many players come from rural
      backgrounds and achieve success through hard work and determination. In
      recent years, Kabaddi players have gained international recognition due to
      leagues like the Pro Kabaddi League. This has helped improve their
      lifestyle and popularity. Kabaddi players are now seen as role models for
      young athletes. Overall, the players of Kabaddi are the heart of the game,
      and their courage, teamwork, and skill make Kabaddi a thrilling sport to
      watch and play. ---
